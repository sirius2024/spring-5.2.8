/**
 * This interface represents a generic runtime joinpoint (in the AOP
 * terminology).
 *
 * Joinpoint是AOP的连接点。一个连接点代表一个被代理的方法。
 * Joinpoint分为动态和静态，且有一个拦截器链作用于Joinpoint.
 * Spring提供的Joinpoint实现类只有ReflectiveMethodInvocation类。当然这个类实现了Joinpoint的扩展来，要比Jointpoint功能强大
 *
 * 总结:
 * 连接点是Spring AOP中的最小单元。连接点里存放了代理对象的目标类，目标方法，方法拦截器。进行代理的时候，调用拦截器MethodInterceptor的加强方法，执行代理方法。
 *
 * <p>A runtime joinpoint is an <i>event</i> that occurs on a static
 * joinpoint (i.e. a location in a the program). For instance, an
 * invocation is the runtime joinpoint on a method (static joinpoint).
 * The static part of a given joinpoint can be generically retrieved
 * using the {@link #getStaticPart()} method.
 *
 * <p>In the context of an interception framework, a runtime joinpoint
 * is then the reification of an access to an accessible object (a
 * method, a constructor, a field), i.e. the static part of the
 * joinpoint. It is passed to the interceptors that are installed on
 * the static joinpoint.
